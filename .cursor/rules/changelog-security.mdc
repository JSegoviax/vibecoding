# Changelog: Security and Content Rules

When editing `src/data/changelog.ts` or adding changelog entries from git history:

## Never add to the changelog

- **Security-sensitive details:** How host/lobby identity is determined (e.g. URL params like `?host=1`, sessionStorage, cookies), auth flows, API keys, or backend validation.
- **Implementation details that could enable abuse:** Anything that tells a user exactly how to mimic the host, bypass checks, or exploit the game.
- **Internal jargon:** Variable names, function names, file names, or tech stack (Vercel, Supabase, etc.). Use plain, player-facing language instead.

## Do use

- **Outcome-only descriptions:** e.g. "Fixed a bug where the second player was incorrectly identified as the Host" instead of explaining how host detection works.
- **Generic stability lines:** e.g. "Stability: Fixed a rare crash during …" without mentioning build systems or internal types.

When in doubt, describe *what changed for the player*, not *how it was implemented*.
